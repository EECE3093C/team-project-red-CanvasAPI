- All API access is over HTTPS
- All API responses are in JSON format
- Account calendars
- Student reports for assignment priority 
- Assignments tab also for priority and due date
- Use calendar events tab for doing a visual layout of the schedule
- Could use courses tab if we wanted to keep track of the number of assignments for the whole semester
- Planner notes could be cool to implement as reminders
- Need a key to identify with the API as a client/user to actually make calls to the API
